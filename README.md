Project Name: Predict Home Mortgage Application Origination/Outcome

Project Summary
The purpose of this project is to predict home mortgage applications outcomes using publicly available data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The focus of the project will be to use various metrics within the chosen dataset including, income, race, gender, location, debt-to-income ratio to determine the predictive value of these metrics on the application outcome. For the purposes of this project loan originated is the desired outcome.

Project Tasks
The specific tasks associated with this project are designed to align with and adhere to the standard data science project lifecycle. The project will be initiated with the data collection phase and end with the primary model selection and analysis.

About the Data
The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) is a federal statute that requires financial institutions to maintain and disclose loan-level mortgage originations data for various federally mandated purposes. The dataset contains non-personally identifiable applicant and borrower data for each mortgage originated and sold to a government service agency (GSA). The dataset is traditionally used for policy making, pattern and practice evaluation, and other mandated purposes such as monitoring lending practices by financial institutions to track issues related to racial disparities in consumer lending.
